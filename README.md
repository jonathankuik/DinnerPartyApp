After taking the Udacity course <a href='https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088'>Full Stack Foundations</a> I created this simple "Dinner Party Registration" application using Flask and SQLAlchemy and deployed it to Heroku.

The app can be seen here: <a href='https://guarded-sea-14434.herokuapp.com/home'>Dinner Party App</a>
