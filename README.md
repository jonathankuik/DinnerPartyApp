# DinnerPartyApp

A fully functioning Flask application I created while completing the course <a href='https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088'>Full Stack Foundations class</a>. The app can be found here: <a href='https://guarded-sea-14434.herokuapp.com'>Dinner Party App</a> and allows a user to create a "dinner date" at my house and choose the menu. 

This app is written in Python, using the Flask Framework and is deployed to Heroku. This app also demonstrates use of the Bootstrap CSS framework, Javascript, and Postgres DB.
